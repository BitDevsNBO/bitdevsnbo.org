## Taproot: Boosting Privacy, Efficiency & Smart‑Contract Power in Bitcoin

### 🧠 Proposal Summary
Taproot is a major Bitcoin protocol upgrade that integrates Schnorr signatures and Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees (MAST) to deliver stronger privacy, lower fees, and richer smart‑contract functionality.

### 🔍 Discussion Points

- **Why Taproot?**  
  A brief history of Schnorr + MAST and why Greg Maxwell proposed Taproot in 2018  
- **How Taproot works**  
  - Schnorr signatures & signature aggregation  
  - MAST–style script trees that reveal only the executed branch  
- **Privacy improvements**  
  - Multi‑sig/spend‑condition transactions now look like single‑sig spends  
  - Conceals complex contract logic until it is actually exercised  
- **Efficiency gains**  
  - Smaller witness data ⇒ lower on‑chain footprint & fees  
  - Faster validation and batching benefits for nodes & hardware wallets  
- **Expanded smart‑contract design space**  
  - Easier Pay‑to‑Contract, DLCs, vaults, CoinJoin upgrades  
  - Potential DeFi‑like primitives on Bitcoin  
- **Open questions / trade‑offs**  
  - Adoption hurdles (wallets, exchanges, hardware support)  
  - Miner policy considerations & fee‑market dynamics  
  - Does greater contract flexibility invite regulatory scrutiny?  
- **Future roadmap**  
  - What Taproot enables next: BitVM, covenants, cross‑chain bridges, etc.

### ✍🏾 Suggested Format

- **5‑minute walkthrough** – Quick primer on Schnorr, MAST, and what changes on‑chain  
- **10-15 minute open discussion** – Pros, cons, and brainstorming future Taproot‑powered projects
