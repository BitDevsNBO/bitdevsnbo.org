## The Impact of Increasing `OP_RETURN` Data Limit from 83 Bytes to ~4MB

### üß† Proposal Summary

Recent experiments and discussions in the Bitcoin developer community have explored the implications of increasing the `OP_RETURN` data size limit from the current 83 bytes to the full block size (~4MB). This topic invites us to evaluate the technical, economic, and philosophical ramifications of such a change.

### üîç Discussion Points

- A brief history of `OP_RETURN`: why it was introduced and limited
- How it‚Äôs currently used (e.g., inscriptions, asset tags, metadata)
- What would change if the limit was lifted?
- Pros:
  - Greater flexibility for data storage on-chain
  - New applications (e.g., NFTs, RWA tags, protocols like RGB)
- Cons:
  - Block space abuse & bloat
  - Miners' incentive misalignment
  - Possible regulatory/legal implications
- Does Bitcoin risk becoming a data dump?
- Comparisons to inscriptions, ordinals, and other methods of on-chain data embedding
- Should `OP_RETURN` be used at all for this? Or are better alternatives like Taproot available?

### üßë‚Äçüè´ Suggested Format

- 5-minute topic walkthrough
- 15-20 minute open discussion
